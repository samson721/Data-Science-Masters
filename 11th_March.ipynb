For example, a one-tailed test could be used to test the hypothesis that a new drug is more effective than an existing drug. The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in effectiveness between the two drugs, while the alternative hypothesis would be that the new drug is more effective. In this case, the one-tailed test is used to determine if the sample statistic is significantly greater than the population parameter.\n",

    "Suppose a certain disease affects 1% of the population. A medical test is available for the disease, and the test correctly identifies the presence of the disease in 95% of cases where the person actually has the disease, and correctly identifies the absence of the disease in 90% of cases where the person does not have the disease. If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",

    "Let A be the event that a person has the disease, and B be the event that a person tests positive for the disease. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that a person has the disease given that they tested positive. By Bayes' Theorem, we have:\n",

    "So the probability that a person actually has the disease given that they tested positive is about 8.7%.
